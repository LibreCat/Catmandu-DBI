0.0135 2015-04-14
  - BUG in Catmandu::Store::DBI for MySQL. identifier 'id' is of type
    'varchar', which is case insensitive.  This can easily be solved with the
    sql statement "alter table scans modify id varchar(255) binary".

0.0134 2015-01-26
  - BUG in Catmandu::Store::DBI: method 'dbh' crashes during global destruction
    (after call to DEMOLISH). Fixed by not accessing DBI interface during this fase.

0.0133 2015-01-16
  - BUG in Catmandu::Store::DBI::Bag: a reference to the database handle is
    stored in a variable outside the callback in function _build_create_*, and
    then used inside the callback. This only works as long as the database handle
    is active. When working with web applications, where these stores are kept in
    memory, and not used for a long time, this can lead to inactive database
    handles. Fix: direct reference from the callback to the function "dbh" of the
    Catmandu::Store::DBI, that automatically reconnects if necessary.

0.0132 2015-01-09
  - BUG for DBD::Pg. When inserting data, column 'data' is not properly escaped
    als PG_BYTEA (see _build_add_postgres in Catmandu::Store::DBI::Bag)

0.0131 2015-01-09
  - Incorrect use of 'state' in function Catmandu::Store::DBI::dbh. Due to this
    bug, only one dbh could be stored. Now also the version in

0.012 2014-10-02
  - Use of function tempfile in test scripts must set the option EXLOCK to '0',
    to avoid locking problems on BSD.  This temporary file is used by SQLite,
    but EXLOCK is set to '1' on some systems.
